# Custom Authentication Project with Next.js 13

This project demonstrates how to implement custom authentication in a Next.js 13 application. Custom authentication allows you to create your own authentication system instead of relying on third-party services like Next-Auth.

## Features

- User login with email and password
- Protected routes that require authentication
- Persistent user sessions using session ids
- Secure password storage with hashing and salting
